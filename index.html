			<h2>About Me</h2>
  			
			<p> <img src="assets/jessicalovellbiophoto.jpg" alt="Jessica" width="150" height="150" align="left"/> Hi! I'm Jessica Lovell. I am an eCommerce Assitant at Ylang 23. My job mainly consists of maintaining and updating the website. I graduated from the University Of North Texas with two degrees in Merchandise and Digital Retailing and a minor in Business Foundations. I'm taking this class so that I can expand my position at my company. </p>
  		 
  		 	<p> My favorite things include shopping, watching The Office endlessly and purchasing books on Amazon that I will never have time to read. I have three dogs. My favorite book is Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. Writing large paragraphs about myself is not my strong suit. My favorite basketball team is the Caveliers and Kevin Love is my favorite player. I'm born and rasied in Dallas. Can you tell I'm really struggling to find things to talk about? </p>
